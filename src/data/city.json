It is in north-central Ukraine along the Dnieper River. As of 1 January 2022, its population was 2,952,301, making Kyiv the seventh-most populous city in Europe. Kyiv is an important industrial, scientific, educational, and cultural center in Eastern Europe. It is home to many high-tech industries, higher education institutions, and historical landmarks. The city has an extensive system of public transport and infrastructure, including the Kyiv Metro.\n</p><p>The city's name is said to derive from the name of Kyi, one of its four legendary founders. During its history, Kyiv, one of the oldest cities in Eastern Europe, passed through several stages of prominence and obscurity. The city probably existed as a commercial center as early as the 5th century. A Slavic settlement on the great trade route between Scandinavia and Constantinople, Kyiv was a tributary of the Khazars, until its capture by the Varangians (Vikings) in the mid-9th century. Under Varangian rule, the city became a capital of Kievan Rus', the first East Slavic state. Completely destroyed during the Mongol invasions in 1240, the city lost most of its influence for the centuries to come. Coming under Lithuania, then Poland and then Russia, the city would grow from a frontier market into an important centre of Orthodox learning in the sixteenth century, and later of industry, commerce, and administration by the ninenteenth.</p><p>The city prospered again during the Russian Empire's Industrial Revolution in the late 19th century. In 1918, when the Ukrainian People's Republic declared independence from the Russian Republic after the October Revolution there, Kyiv became its capital. From the end of the Ukrainian-Soviet and Polish-Soviet wars in 1921, Kyiv was a city of the Ukrainian SSR, and made its capital in 1934. The city suffered significant destruction during World War II but quickly recovered in the postwar years, remaining the Soviet Union's third-largest city.\n</p><p>Following the collapse of the Soviet Union and Ukrainian independence in 1991, Kyiv remained Ukraine's capital and experienced a steady influx of ethnic Ukrainian migrants from other regions of the country. During the country's transformation to a market economy and electoral democracy, Kyiv has continued to be Ukraine's largest and wealthiest city. Its armament-dependent industrial output fell after the Soviet collapse, adversely affecting science and technology, but new sectors of the economy such as services and finance facilitated Kyiv's growth in salaries and investment, as well as providing continuous funding for the development of housing and urban infrastructure. Kyiv emerged as the most pro-Western region of Ukraine; parties advocating tighter integration with the European Union dominate during elections.\n</p>\n\n\n<h2><span id=\"Name\">Name</span></h2>\n<ul><li>English: <span lang=\"en\">Kyiv</span> (<span></span> <i title=\"English pronunciation respelling\"><span>KEE</span>-yiv</i>, <span></span> <i title=\"English pronunciation respelling\"><span>KEEV</span></i>) or Kiev (<span></span> <i title=\"English pronunciation respelling\"><span>KEE</span>-ev</i>)</li>\n<li>Ukrainian: <span lang=\"uk\">\u041a\u0438\u0457\u0432</span>, <small>romanized:\u00a0</small><span title=\"Ukrainian-language romanization\"><i lang=\"uk-Latn\">Kyiv</i></span>, <span>pronounced</span> <span lang=\"uk-Latn-fonipa\">[\u02c8k\u026ajiu\u032f]</span> <span></span></li>\n<li>Russian: <span lang=\"ru\">\u041a\u0438\u0435\u0432 (pre-1918 \u041a\u0456\u0435\u0432\u044a)</span>, <small>romanized:\u00a0</small><span title=\"Russian-language romanization\"><i lang=\"ru-Latn\">Kiev</i></span>, <link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1177148991\"><span>pronounced</span> <span lang=\"ru-Latn-fonipa\">[\u02c8k\u02b2i(j)\u026af]</span> <span></span></li></ul><p>Before standardization of the alphabet in the early 20th century, the name was also spelled <span title=\"Ukrainian-language text\"><span lang=\"uk\">\u041a\u044b\u0463\u0432\u044a</span></span>, <span title=\"Ukrainian-language text\"><span lang=\"uk\">\u041a\u0438\u0463\u0432\u044a</span></span>, or <span title=\"Ukrainian-language text\"><span lang=\"uk\">\u041a\u0456\u0463\u0432\u044a</span></span> with the now-obsolete letter yat.

The traditional etymology, stemming from the <i>Primary Chronicle</i>, is that the name is a derivation of Kyi (Ukrainian: <span lang=\"uk\">\u041a\u0438\u0439</span>, Russian: <span lang=\"ru\">\u041a\u0438\u0439 (pre-1918 \u041a\u0456\u0439)</span>), the legendary eponymous founder of the city. According to Oleg Trubachyov's etymological dictionary from the Old East Slavic name <i>*Kyjev\u016d gord\u016d</i> (literally, \"Kyi's castle\", \"Kyi's gord\"), from Proto-Slavic <i>*kyjev\u044a</i>, This etymology has been questioned, for instance by Mykhailo Hrushevsky who called it an \"etymological myth\", and meant that the names of the legendary founders are in turn based on place names. According to the Canadian Ukrainian linguist Jaroslav Rudnyckyj, the name can be connected to the Proto-Slavic root *kyj\u044c, but should be interpreted as meaning 'stick, pole' as in its modern Ukrainian equivalent \u041a\u0438\u0439. The name should in that case be interpreted as 'palisaded settlement'.</p><p><i>Kyiv</i> is the romanized official Ukrainian name for the city, and it is used for legislative and official acts. <i>Kiev</i> is the traditional English name for the city, but because of its historical derivation from the Russian name, <i>Kiev</i> lost favor with many Western media outlets after the outbreak of the Russo-Ukrainian War in 2014.</p><p>The city was known by various names in history. In the Norse sagas it was <span title=\"Old Norse-language text\"><i lang=\"non\">K\u00e6nugar\u00f0r</i></span> or <span title=\"Old Norse-language text\"><i lang=\"non\">K\u0153nugar\u00f0r</i></span>, meaning \"city of the Kyivans\" (from Old East Slavic: <span lang=\"orv\">\u043a\u0438\u044f\u043d\u0435</span>, <small>romanized:\u00a0</small><span title=\"Old East Slavic-language romanization\"><i lang=\"orv-Latn\">kijane</i></span>), which survives in modern Icelandic <span title=\"Icelandic-language text\"><i lang=\"is\">K\u00e6nugar\u00f0ur</i></span>. Perhaps the earliest original manuscript to name the city is the Kyivan letter, written <abbr title=\"circa\">c.</abbr><span>\u2009930</span> CE by representatives of the city's Jewish community, with the name written as <span title=\"Hebrew-language text\"><span lang=\"he\" dir=\"rtl\">\u05e7\u05d9\u05d9\u05d5\u05d1\u05f3</span></span>, <span title=\"Hebrew-language romanization\"><i lang=\"he-Latn\">Qiyy\u014d\u1e07</i></span>.</p><p>The historian Julius Brutzkus in his work <i>The Khazar Origin of Ancient Kiev</i> hypothesizes that both Sambat and Kyiv are of Khazar origin, meaning \"hill fortress\" and \"lower settlement\" respectively. Brutzkus claims that Sambat is not Kyiv, but rather Vyshhorod (High City), which is nearby.\n</p><p>In the Byzantine Greek of Constantine Porphyrogenitus's 10th-century <i>De Administrando Imperio</i> it was <span title=\"Greek-language text\"><span lang=\"el\">\u039a\u03b9\u03bf\u03ac\u03b2\u03b1</span></span>, <span title=\"Greek-language romanization\"><i lang=\"el-Latn\">Kioava</i></span>, <span title=\"Greek-language text\"><span lang=\"el\">\u039a\u03af\u03bf\u03b2\u03b1</span></span>, <span title=\"Greek-language romanization\"><i lang=\"el-Latn\">Kiova</i></span>, and \"also called Sambatas\", <span title=\"Greek-language text\"><span lang=\"el\">\u03a3\u03b1\u03bc\u03b2\u03b1\u03c4\u03ac\u03c2</span></span>.

In the medieval Latin of Thietmar of Merseburg's <i>Chronicon</i> it was mentioned for the year 1015 as <span title=\"Latin-language text\"><i lang=\"la\">Cuieva</i></span>.

Early English sources rendered the city's name as <i>Kiou</i>, <i>Kiow</i>, <i>Kiew</i>, and\u2014as in Latin\u2014<i>Kiovia</i>. On one of the oldest English maps of the region, <span title=\"Latin-language text\"><i lang=\"la\">Russiae, Moscoviae et Tartariae</i></span>, published by Ortelius (London, 1570), the name of the city is spelled <i>Kiou</i>. On the 1650 map by Guillaume de Beauplan, the name of the city is <i>Kiiow</i>, and the region was named <i>K\u00ffowia</i>. In the book <i>Travels</i>, by Joseph Marshall (London, 1772), the city is called <i>Kiovia</i>.</p><p>In English, <i>Kiev</i> appeared in print as early as 1804 in John Cary's \"New map of Europe, from the latest authorities\", and in Mary Holderness's 1823 travelogue <i>New Russia: Journey from Riga to the Crimea by way of Kiev</i>. The <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i> included <i>Kiev</i> in a quotation published by 1883, and <i>Kyiv</i> in 2018.</p><p>The Ukrainian version of the name, <i>Kyiw</i>, appears in the Volume 4 of the Geographical Dictionary of the Kingdom of Poland, published in 1883.</p>\n<p>After Ukraine's independence in 1991, the Ukrainian government introduced the national rules for transliteration of geographic names into the Latin alphabet for legislative and official acts in October 1995, according to which the Ukrainian name <span title=\"Ukrainian-language text\"><span lang=\"uk\">\u041a\u0438\u0457\u0432</span></span> is romanized <i>Kyiv</i>. These rules are applied for place names and addresses, as well as personal names in passports, street signs, and so on.\n</p><p>In 2018, the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry launched #CorrectUA, an online campaign to promote the use of official Ukrainian spellings by countries and organizations, in place of \"outdated, Soviet-era\" place-names. Specifically, for the capital, the campaign KyivNotKiev was developed as part of the broader campaign.\n</p><p>The place name <i>Kyiv</i> is standardized in the authoritative database of Ukraine's toponyms maintained by Ukraine's mapping agency Derzhheokadastr. It has also been adopted by the United Nations GEGN Geographical Names Database, the United States Board on Geographic Names, the International Air Transport Association, the European Union, English-speaking foreign diplomatic missions and governments, several international organizations, and the <i>Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica</i>. Some English-language news sources have adopted <span title=\"Ukrainian-language text\"><i lang=\"uk-Latn\">Kyiv</i></span> in their style guides, including the AP, CP, Reuters, and AFP news services, media organizations in Ukraine, and some media organizations in Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States, despite more resistance to the spelling change compared to others, like <i>Beijing</i> and <i>Mumbai</i>.</p><p>Alternative romanizations used in English-language sources include <i>Ky\u00efv</i> (according to the ALA\u2013LC romanization used in bibliographic cataloguing), <i>Kyjiv</i> (scholarly transliteration used in linguistics), and <i>Kyyiv</i> (the 1965 BGN/PCGN transliteration standard).\n</p><p>The US media organization NPR adopted an on-air pronunciation of <i>Kyiv</i> closer to the Ukrainian, responding to the history and identity of the local population, in January 2022.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"History\">History</span></h2>\n<link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1033289096\">\n<link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1033289096\">\n<link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1033289096\">\n<p>The first known humans in the region of Kyiv lived there in the late paleolithic period (Stone Age). The population around Kyiv during the Bronze Age formed part of the so-called Trypillian culture, as evidenced by artifacts from that culture found in the area. During the early Iron Age certain tribes settled around Kyiv that practiced land cultivation, husbandry and trading with the Scythians and ancient states of the northern Black Sea coast. Findings of Roman coins of the 2nd to the 4th centuries suggest trade relations with the eastern provinces of the Roman Empire. Notable archaeologists of the area around Kyiv include Vikentiy Khvoyka.\n</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Founding\">Founding</span></h3>\n<p>Scholars continue to debate when the city was founded: The traditional founding date is 482 CE, so the city celebrated its 1,500th anniversary in 1982. Archaeological data indicates a founding in the sixth or seventh centuries, with some researchers dating the founding as late as the late 9th century.</p>\n<p>There are several legendary accounts of the origin of the city. One tells of members of a Slavic tribe (Eastern Polans), brothers Kyi (the eldest, after whom the city was named), Shchek, Khoryv, and their sister Lybid, who founded the city (See the <i>Primary Chronicle</i>). Another legend states that Saint Andrew passed through the area in the 1st century. Where the city is now he erected a cross, where a church later was built. Since the Middle Ages an image of Saint Michael has represented the city as well as the duchy.\n</p>\n<p>There is little historical evidence pertaining to the period when the city was founded. Scattered Slavic settlements existed in the area from the 6th century, but it is unclear whether any of them later developed into the city. On the Ptolemy world map there are several settlements indicated along the mid-stream of Borysthenes, among which is Azagarium, which some historians believe to be the predecessor to Kyiv.</p><p>However, according to the 1773 <i>Dictionary of Ancient Geography</i> of Alexander Macbean, that settlement corresponds to the modern city of Chernobyl. Just south of Azagarium, there is another settlement, Amadoca, believed to be the capital of the Amadoci people living in an area between the marshes of Amadoca in the west and the Amadoca mountains in the east.\n</p><p>Another name for Kyiv mentioned in history, the origin of which is not completely clear, is Sambat, which apparently has something to do with the Khazar Empire. The <i>Primary Chronicle</i> says the residents of Kyiv told Askold \"there were three brothers Kyi, Shchek, and Khoriv. They founded this town and died, and now we are staying and paying taxes to their relatives the Khazars\". In <i>De Administrando Imperio</i>, Constantine Porphyrogenitus mentions a caravan of small cargo boats which assembled annually, and writes, \"They come down the river Dnieper and assemble at the strong-point of Kyiv (Kioava), also called Sambatas\".</p><p>At least three Arabic-speaking 10th century geographers who traveled the area mention the city of Z\u0101nbat as the chief city of the Russes. Among them are ibn Rustah, Abu Sa'id Gardezi, and an author of the Hudud al-'Alam. The texts of those authors were discovered by Russian orientalist Alexander Tumansky. The etymology of Sambat has been argued by many historians, including Grigoriy Ilyinsky, Nikolay Karamzin, Jan Potocki, Nikolay Lambin, Joachim Lelewel, and Gu\u00f0brandur Vigf\u00fasson.\n</p><p>The Primary Chronicle states that at some point during the late 9th or early 10th century Askold and Dir, who may have been of Viking or Varangian descent, ruled in Kyiv. They were murdered by Oleg of Novgorod in 882, but some historians, such as Omeljan Pritsak and Constantine Zuckerman, dispute that, arguing that Khazar rule continued as late as the 920s, leaving historical documents such as the Kyivan Letter and Schechter Letter.\n</p><p>Other historians suggest that Magyar tribes ruled the city between 840 and 878, before migrating with some Khazar tribes to the Carpathian Basin. The Primary Chronicle mentions Hungarians passing near Kyiv. Askold's Grave was previously known as \"Uhorske urochyshche\" (Hungarian place).</p><p>According to the aforementioned scholars the building of the fortress of Kyiv was finished in 840 under the leadership of Ke\u0151 (Keve), Cs\u00e1k, and Ger\u00e9b, three brothers, possibly members of the Tarj\u00e1n tribe. The three names appear in the Kyiv Chronicle as Kyi, Shchek, and Khoryv and may be not of Slavic origin, as Russian historians have always struggled to account for their meanings and origins. According to Hungarian historian Viktor Pad\u00e1nyi, their names were inserted into the Kyiv Chronicle in the 12th century, and they were identified as old-Russian mythological heroes.</p>\n<p>The city of Kyiv stood on the trade route between the Varangians and the Greeks. In 968 the nomadic Pechenegs attacked and then besieged the city. By 1000 CE the city had a population of 45,000.</p><p>In March 1169, Grand Prince Andrey Bogolyubsky of Vladimir-Suzdal sacked Kyiv, leaving the old town and the prince's hall in ruins. He took many pieces of religious artwork - including the <i>Theotokos of Vladimir</i> icon - from Vyshhorod. In 1203, Prince Rurik Rostislavich and his Kipchak allies captured and burned Kyiv. In the 1230s, the city was besieged and ravaged several times by different Rus princes. The city had not recovered from these attacks when, in 1240, the Mongol invasion of Rus', led by Batu Khan, completed the destruction of Kyiv.</p><p>These events had a profound effect on the future of the city and on the East Slavic civilization. Before Bogolyubsky's pillaging, Kyiv had had a reputation as one of the largest cities in the world, with a population exceeding 100,000 at the beginning of the 12th century.</p><p>In the early 1320s, a Lithuanian army led by Grand Duke Gediminas defeated a Slavic army led by Stanislav of Kyiv at the Battle on the Irpen' River and conquered the city. The Tatars, who also claimed Kyiv, retaliated in 1324\u20131325, so while Kyiv was ruled by a Lithuanian prince, it had to pay tribute to the Golden Horde. Finally, as a result of the Battle of Blue Waters in 1362, Algirdas, Grand Duke of Lithuania, incorporated Kyiv and surrounding areas into the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. In 1482, Crimean Tatars sacked and burned much of Kyiv. At the time of the Lithuanian rule, the core of the city was located in Podil and there was a Lithuanian Kyiv Castle with 18 towers on the Zamkova Hora which served as a residence of Vladimir Olgerdovich, Grand Prince of Kyiv, and subsequently of the Grand Dukes of Lithuania (e.g. Vytautas).</p>\n<p>With the 1569 Union of Lublin, when the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth was established, the Lithuanian-controlled lands of the Kyiv region (Podolia, Volhynia, and Podlachia) were transferred from the Grand Duchy of Lithuania to the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland, and Kyiv became the capital of Kyiv Voivodeship. The 1658 Treaty of Hadiach envisaged Kyiv becoming the capital of the Grand Duchy of Rus' within the Polish\u2013Lithuanian\u2013Ruthenian Commonwealth, but this provision of the treaty never went into operation.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Russian_suzerainty\">Russian suzerainty</span></h3>\n<p>Occupied by Russian troops since the 1654 Treaty of Pereyaslav, Kyiv became a part of the Tsardom of Russia from 1667 on the Truce of Andrusovo and enjoyed a degree of autonomy. None of the Polish-Russian treaties concerning Kyiv have ever been ratified. In the Russian Empire, Kyiv was a primary Christian centre, attracting pilgrims, and the cradle of many of the empire's most important religious figures, but until the 19th century, the city's commercial importance remained marginal.\n</p>\n<p>In 1834, the Russian government established Saint Vladimir University, now called the Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv after the Ukrainian poet Taras Shevchenko (1814\u20131861). (Shevchenko worked as a field researcher and editor for the geography department). The medical faculty of Saint Vladimir University, separated into an independent institution in 1919\u20131921 during the Soviet period, became the Bogomolets National Medical University in 1995.\n</p><p>During the 18th and 19th centuries, the Imperial Russian Army and ecclesiastical authorities dominated city life; the Russian Orthodox Church had involvement in a significant part of Kyiv's infrastructure and commercial activity. In the late 1840s the historian, Mykola Kostomarov (Russian: <span title=\"Russian-language romanization\"><i lang=\"ru-Latn\">Nikolai Kostomarov</i></span>), founded a secret political society, the Brotherhood of Saint Cyril and Methodius, whose members put forward the idea of a federation of free Slavic peoples with Ukrainians as a distinct and separate group rather than a subordinate part of the Russian nation; the Russian authorities quickly suppressed the society.\n</p><p>Following the gradual loss of Ukraine's autonomy, Kyiv experienced growing Russification in the 19th century, by means of Russian migration, administrative actions, and social modernization. At the beginning of the 20th century the Russian-speaking part of the population dominated the city centre, while the lower classes living on the outskirts retained Ukrainian folk culture to a significant extent. However, enthusiasts among ethnic Ukrainian aristocrats, soldiers, and merchants made attempts to preserve the native culture in Kyiv, by clandestine book-printing, amateur theatre, folk studies, etc.\n</p>\n<p>During the Russian industrial revolution in the late 19th century, Kyiv became an important trade and transportation centre of the Russian Empire, specialising in sugar and grain export by railway and on the Dnieper river. By 1900, the city had also become a significant industrial centre, with a population of 250,000. Landmarks of that period include the railway infrastructure, the foundation of numerous educational and cultural facilities, and notable architectural monuments (mostly merchant-oriented). In 1892, the first electric tram line of the Russian Empire started running in Kyiv (the third in the world). Kyiv prospered during the late 19th century Industrial Revolution in the Russian Empire, when it became the third most important city of the Empire and the major centre of commerce in its southwest.\n</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Soviet_era\">Soviet era</span></h3>\n<p>In the turbulent period following the 1917 Russian Revolution, Kyiv became the capital of several successive Ukrainian states and was caught in the middle of several conflicts: World War I, during which German soldiers occupied it from 2 March 1918 to November 1918, the Russian Civil War of 1917 to 1922, and the Polish\u2013Soviet War of 1919\u20131921. During the last three months of 1919, Kyiv was intermittently controlled by the White Army. Kyiv changed hands sixteen times from the end of 1918 to August 1920.</p><p>From 1921 to 1991, the city formed part of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, which became a founding republic of the Soviet Union in 1922. The major events that took place in Soviet Ukraine during the interwar period all affected Kyiv: the 1920s Ukrainization as well as the migration of the rural Ukrainophone population made the Russophone city Ukrainian-speaking and bolstered the development of Ukrainian cultural life in the city; the Soviet industrialization that started in the late 1920s turned the city, a former centre of commerce and religion, into a major industrial, technological and scientific centre; the 1932\u20131933 Great Famine devastated the part of the migrant population not registered for ration cards; and Joseph Stalin's Great Purge of 1937\u20131938 almost eliminated the city's intelligentsia</p><p>In 1934, Kyiv became the capital of Soviet Ukraine. The city boomed again during the years of Soviet industrialization as its population grew rapidly and many industrial giants were established, some of which exist today.\n</p>\n<p>In World War II, the city again suffered significant damage, and Nazi Germany occupied it from 19 September 1941 to 6 November 1943. Axis forces killed or captured more than 600,000 Soviet soldiers in the great encircling Battle of Kyiv in 1941. Most of those captured never returned alive. Shortly after the Wehrmacht occupied the city, a team of NKVD officers who had remained hidden dynamited most of the buildings on the Khreshchatyk, the main street of the city, where German military and civil authorities had occupied most of the buildings; the buildings burned for days and 25,000 people were left homeless.\n</p><p>Allegedly in response to the actions of the NKVD, the Germans rounded up all the local Jews they could find, nearly 34,000, and massacred them at Babi Yar in Kyiv on 29 and 30 September 1941. In the months that followed, thousands more were taken to Babi Yar where they were shot. It is estimated that the Germans murdered more than 100,000 people of various ethnic groups, mostly civilians, at Babi Yar during World War II.</p>\n<p>Kyiv recovered economically in the post-war years, becoming once again the third-most important city of the Soviet Union. The catastrophic accident at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant in 1986 occurred only 100\u00a0km (62\u00a0mi) north of the city. However, the prevailing south wind blew most of the radioactive debris away from Kyiv.\n</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Independence\">Independence</span></h3>\n<p>In the course of the collapse of the Soviet Union the Ukrainian parliament proclaimed the Declaration of Independence of Ukraine in the city on 24 August 1991. In 2004\u20132005, the city played host to the largest post-Soviet public demonstrations up to that time, in support of the Orange Revolution. From November 2013 until February 2014, central Kyiv became the primary location of Euromaidan. During the onset of the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Russian forces attempted to seize Kyiv but were repelled by Ukrainian forces on the outskirts of the city. Following the Russian retreat from the region in April 2022, Kyiv has been subject to frequent aerial attacks.\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Environment\">Environment</span></h2>\n<link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1033289096\">\n<h3><span id=\"Geography\">Geography</span></h3>\n<p>Geographically, Kyiv is on the border of the Polesia woodland ecological zone, a part of the European mixed woods area, and the East European forest steppe biome. However, the city's unique landscape distinguishes it from the surrounding region. Kyiv is completely surrounded by Kyiv Oblast.\n</p><p>Originally on the west bank, today Kyiv is on both sides of the Dnieper, which flows southwards through the city towards the Black Sea. The older and higher western part of the city sits on numerous wooded hills (Kyiv Hills), with ravines and small rivers. Kyiv's geographical relief contributed to its toponyms, such as <i>Podil</i> (\"lower\"), <i>Pechersk</i> (\"caves\"), and <i>uzviz</i> (a steep street, \"descent\"). Kyiv is a part of the larger Dnieper Upland adjoining the western bank of the Dnieper in its mid-flow, and which contributes to the city's elevation change.\n</p><p>The northern outskirts of the city border the Polesian Lowland. Kyiv expanded into the Dnieper Lowland on the left bank (<i>to the east</i>) as late as the 20th century. The whole portion of Kyiv on the left bank of the Dnieper is generally referred to as the <i>Left Bank</i> (<span title=\"Ukrainian-language text\"><span lang=\"uk\">\u041b\u0456\u0432\u0438\u0439 \u0431\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0433</span></span>, <i>Livyi bereh</i>). Significant areas of the left bank Dnieper valley were artificially sand-deposited, and are protected by dams.\n</p><p>Within the city the Dnieper River forms a branching system of tributaries, isles, and harbors within the city limits. The city is close to the mouth of the Desna River and the Kyiv Reservoir in the north, and the Kaniv Reservoir in the south. Both the Dnieper and Desna rivers are navigable at Kyiv, although regulated by the reservoir shipping locks and limited by winter freeze-over.\n</p><p>In total, there are 448 bodies of open water within the boundaries of Kyiv, which include the Dnieper itself, its reservoirs, and several small rivers, dozens of lakes and artificially created ponds. They occupy 7949 hectares. Additionally, the city has 16 developed beaches (totalling 140 hectares) and 35 near-water recreational areas (covering more than 1,000 hectares). Many are used for pleasure and recreation, although some of the bodies of water are not suitable for swimming.</p><p>According to the UN 2011 evaluation, there were no risks of natural disasters in Kyiv and its metropolitan area.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Climate\">Climate</span></h3>\n<p>Kyiv has a warm-summer humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen <i>Dfb</i>). The warmest months are June, July, and August, with mean temperatures of 13.8 to 24.8\u00a0\u00b0C (56.8 to 76.6\u00a0\u00b0F). The coldest are December, January, and February, with mean temperatures of \u22124.6 to \u22121.1\u00a0\u00b0C (23.7 to 30.0\u00a0\u00b0F). The highest ever temperature recorded in the city was 39.4\u00a0\u00b0C (102.9\u00a0\u00b0F) on 30 July 1936.</p><p>The coldest temperature ever recorded in the city was \u221232.9\u00a0\u00b0C (\u221227.2\u00a0\u00b0F) on 11 January 1951. Snow cover usually lies from mid-November to the end of March, with the frost-free period lasting 180 days on average, but surpassing 200 days in some years.</p>\n\n<h2><span id=\"Legal_status.2C_local_government_and_politics\"></span><span id=\"Legal_status,_local_government_and_politics\">Legal status, local government and politics</span></h2>\n<h3><span id=\"Legal_status_and_local_government\">Legal status and local government</span></h3>\n<link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1033289096\">\n<p>The municipality of the city of Kyiv has a special legal status within Ukraine compared to the other administrative subdivisions of the country.

In a poll conducted by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology in the first half of February 2014, 5.3% of those polled in Kyiv believed \"Ukraine and Russia must unite into a single state\", nationwide this percentage was 12.5.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Subdivisions\">Subdivisions</span></h3>\n<link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1033289096\">\n<link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1033289096\">\n<h4><span id=\"Traditional_subdivision\">Traditional subdivision</span></h4>\n<p>The Dnieper River naturally divides Kyiv into the Right Bank and the Left Bank areas. Historically on the western right bank of the river, the city expanded into the left bank only in the 20th century. Most of Kyiv's attractions as well as the majority of business and governmental institutions are on the right bank. The eastern \"Left Bank\" is predominantly residential. There are large industrial and green areas in both the Right Bank and the Left Bank.\n</p><p>Kyiv is further informally divided into historical or territorial neighbourhoods, each housing from about 5,000 to 100,000 inhabitants.\n</p>\n\n<h4><span id=\"Formal_subdivision\">Formal subdivision</span></h4>\n<p>The first known formal subdivision of Kyiv dates to 1810 when the city was subdivided into 4 parts: Pechersk, Starokyiv, and the first and the second parts of Podil. In 1833\u20131834 according to Tsar Nicholas I's decree, Kyiv was subdivided into 6 police raions (districts); later being increased to 10. In 1917, there were 8 Raion Councils (<i>Duma</i>), which were reorganised by bolsheviks into 6 Party-Territory Raions.\n</p><p>During the Soviet era, as the city was expanding, the number of raions also gradually increased. These newer districts of the city, along with some older areas were then named in honour of prominent communists and socialist-revolutionary figures; however, due to the way in which many communist party members eventually, after a certain period of time, fell out of favour and so were replaced with new, fresher minds, so too did the names of Kyiv's districts change accordingly.\n</p><p>The last raion reform took place in 2001 when the number of raions was decreased from 14 to 10.\n</p><p>Under Oleksandr Omelchenko (mayor from 1999 to 2006), there were further plans for the merger of some raions and revision of their boundaries, and the total number of raions had been planned to be decreased from 10 to 7. With the election of the new mayor-elect (Leonid Chernovetskyi) in 2006, these plans were shelved.\n</p><p>Each raion has its own locally elected council with jurisdiction over a limited scope of affairs.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Demographics\">Demographics</span></h2>\n<link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1097763485\"><link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1033289096\">\n<p>According to the official registration statistics, there were 2,847,200 residents within the city limits of Kyiv in July 2013.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Historical_population\">Historical population</span></h3>\n<p>According to the All-Ukrainian Census, the population of Kyiv in 2001 was 2,611,300. The historic changes in population are shown in the side table. According to the census, some 1,393,000 (53.3%) were female and 1,219,000 (46.7%) were male. Comparing the results with the previous census (1989) shows the trend of population ageing which, while prevalent throughout the country, is partly offset in Kyiv by the inflow of working age migrants. Some 1,069,700 people had higher or completed secondary education, a significant increase of 21.7% since 1989.\n</p><p>The June 2007 unofficial population estimate based on amount of bakery products sold in the city (thus including temporary visitors and commuters) gave a number of at least 3.5\u00a0million people.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Ethnic_composition\">Ethnic composition</span></h3>\n<p>Kyiv's ethnic composition has shifted greatly over the last centuries. According to the census of March 2, 1874, conducted by the local branch of the Russian Geographical Society, there were 127,205 people living in Kyiv. Of these, 80% spoke \"Russian,\" 11% spoke \"Jewish,\" 6% spoke Polish and 2% spoke German. Of the \"Russian\" speakers, 39% were recorded as speaking Little Russian (Ukrainian), which meant that Ukrainian speakers accounted for 30% of the city as a whole. Of the remaining \"Russian\" speakers, however, there were only 10% who spoke Greater Russian (Russian) and 2% who spoke Belarusian. The remaining 49% spoke in \"generally Russian speech.\" According to the official census of 1897, the number of Great Russian speakers rose to 54%; speakers of Little Russian accounted for 22%. Jewish speakers accounted for 12%, Polish 6.7%.</p><p>By the September 1917 city-census of Kyiv, conducted by the authorities of the Ukrainian People's Republic, the Ukrainian share of the population had been reduced to only 16%, while Russians now made up a majority at 50%. The March 1919 Kyiv city census, conducted by the Bolshevik authorities, showed an increase in the percentage of the population identifying as Ukrainian to 25%. From then on, the city's Ukrainian population once again began to expand in terms of their share of the population, slowly returning to its former level. By the 1926 Soviet census, Ukrainians, at 41.6%, had once again begun to outnumber Russians, who made up 25.5%. By the 1959 Soviet census, Kyiv was once more a Ukrainian majority city, with 60% of the population identifying as such, the same percentage as in 1874.</p><p>According to the 2001 census data, more than 130 nationalities and ethnic groups reside within the territory of Kyiv. Ukrainians constitute the largest ethnic group in Kyiv, accounting for 2,110,800 people, or 82.2% of the population. Russians comprise 337,300 (13.1%), Jews 17,900 (0.7%), Belarusians 16,500 (0.6%), Poles 6,900 (0.3%), Armenians 4,900 (0.2%), Azerbaijanis 2,600 (0.1%), Tatars 2,500 (0.1%), Georgians 2,400 (0.1%), Moldovans 1,900 (0.1%).</p><p>A 2015 study by the International Republican Institute found that 94% of Kyiv was ethnic Ukrainian, and 5% ethnic Russian. Most of the city's non-Slav population comprises Tatars, South Caucasians, and other peoples from the former Soviet Union.\n</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Language_statistics\">Language statistics</span></h3>\n<p>Both Ukrainian and Russian are commonly spoken in the city; approximately 75% of Kyiv's population responded \"Ukrainian\" to the 2001 census question on their native language, roughly 25% responded \"Russian\". According to a 2006 survey, Ukrainian is used at home by 23% of Kyivans, 52% use Russian, and 24% switch between both. In the 2003 sociological survey, when the question \"What language do you use in everyday life?\" was asked, 52% said \"mostly Russian\", 32% \"both Russian and Ukrainian in equal measure\", 14% \"mostly Ukrainian\", and 4.3% \"exclusively Ukrainian\".</p><p>According to the census of 1897, of Kyiv's approximately 240,000 people approximately 56% of the population spoke the Russian language, 23% spoke the Ukrainian language, 13% spoke Yiddish, 7% spoke Polish and 1% spoke the Belarusian language.</p><p>A 2015 study by the International Republican Institute found that the languages spoken at home in Kyiv were Ukrainian (27%), Russian (32%), and an equal combination of Ukrainian and Russian (40%).</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Jews\">Jews</span></h3>\n<link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1033289096\">\n<p>The Jews of Kyiv are first mentioned in a 10th-century letter. The Jewish population remained relatively small until the nineteenth century. A series of pogroms was carried out in 1882, and another in 1905. On the eve of World War I, the city's Jewish population was over 81,000. In 1939 there were approximately 224,000 Jews in Kyiv, some of whom fled the city ahead of the German invasion of the Soviet Union that began in June 1941. On 29 and 30 September 1941, nearly 34,000 Kyivan Jews were massacred at Babi Yar by the Wehrmacht, SS, Ukrainian Auxiliary Police, and local collaborators.</p><p>Jews began returning to Kyiv at the end of the war, but experienced another pogrom in September 1945. In the 21st century, Kyiv's Jewish community numbers about 20,000. There are two major synagogues in the city: the Great Choral Synagogue and the Brodsky Choral Synagogue.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Cityscape\">Cityscape</span></h2>\n<link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1033289096\">\n\n<p>Modern Kyiv is a mix of the old (Kyiv preserved about 70 percent of more than 1,000 buildings built during 1907\u20131914) and the new, seen in everything from the architecture to the stores and to the people themselves. When the capital of the Ukrainian SSR was moved from Kharkiv to Kyiv many new buildings were commissioned to give the city \"the gloss and polish of a capital\". In the discussions that centered on how to create a showcase city center, the current city center of Khreshchatyk and Maidan Nezalezhnosti (Independence Square) were not the obvious choices. Some of the early, ultimately not materialised, ideas included a part of Pechersk, Lypky, European Square, and Mykhailivska Square.</p><p>The plans of building massive monuments (of Vladimir Lenin and Stalin) were also abandoned, due to lack of money (in the 1930s\u20131950s) and because of Kyiv's hilly landscape. Experiencing rapid population growth between the 1970s and the mid-1990s, the city has continued its consistent growth after the turn of the millennium. As a result, Kyiv's central districts provide a dotted contrast of new, modern buildings among the pale yellows, blues, and greys of older apartments. Urban sprawl has gradually reduced, while population densities of suburbs has increased. The most expensive properties are in the Pechersk and Khreshchatyk areas. It is also prestigious to own a property in newly constructed buildings in the Kharkivskyi neighborhood or Obolon along the Dnieper.\n</p><p>Ukrainian independence at the turn of the millennium has heralded other changes. Western-style residential complexes, modern nightclubs, classy restaurants and prestigious hotels opened in the centre. And most importantly, with the easing of the visa rules in 2005, Ukraine is positioning itself as a prime tourist attraction, with Kyiv, among the other large cities, looking to profit from new opportunities. The centre of Kyiv has been cleaned up and buildings have been restored and redecorated, especially Khreshchatyk and Maidan Nezalezhnosti. Many historic areas of Kyiv, such as Andriivskyi Descent, have become popular street vendor locations, where one can find traditional Ukrainian art, religious items, books, game sets (most commonly chess) as well as jewellery for sale.</p><p>At the United Nations Climate Change Conference 2009, Kyiv was the only Commonwealth of Independent States city to have been inscribed into the TOP30 European Green City Index (placed 30th).</p><p>Kyiv's most famous historical architecture complexes are the St. Sophia Cathedral and the Kyiv Pechersk Lavra (Monastery of the Caves), which are recognized by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site. Noteworthy historical architectural landmarks also include the Mariinskyi Palace (designed and constructed from 1745 to 1752, then reconstructed in 1870), several Eastern Orthodox churches such as St. Michael's Cathedral, St. Andrew's, St. Volodymyr's, St. Cyril's, the reconstructed Golden Gate and others.\n</p><p>One of Kyiv's widely recognized modern landmarks is the highly visible giant Mother Ukraine statue made of titanium standing at the National Museum of the History of Ukraine in the Second World War on the Right bank of the Dnieper. Other notable sites is the cylindrical Salut hotel, across from Glory Square and the eternal flame at the World War Two memorial Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, and the House with Chimaeras.\n</p><p>Among Kyiv's best-known monuments are Mikhail Mikeshin's statue of Bohdan Khmelnytsky astride his horse near St. Sophia Cathedral, the venerated Vladimir the Great (St. Vladimir), the baptizer of Rus', overlooking the river above Podil from Saint Volodymyr Hill, the monument to Kyi, Shchek and Khoryv and Lybid, the legendary founders of the city at the Dnieper embankment. On Independence Square in the city centre, two monuments elevate two of the city protectors; the historic protector of Kyiv Michael Archangel atop a reconstruction of one of the old city's gates and a modern invention, the goddess-protector Berehynia atop a tall column.\n</p>\n<ul class=\"gallery mw-gallery-packed\"><li class=\"gallerycaption\">Architecture and historically significant sites and monuments in Kyiv</li>\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 172px\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 182px\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 162px\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 78.666666666667px\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 182px\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 156.66666666667px\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 82px\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 92px\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 182.66666666667px\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 184px\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 169.33333333333px\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t<li class=\"gallerybox\" style=\"width: 176px\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</li>\n</ul><h2><span id=\"Culture\">Culture</span></h2>\n<link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1033289096\">\n<p>Kyiv was the historic cultural centre of the East Slavic civilization and a major cradle for the Christianization of Kyivan Rus.

Both of these teams play in the highest Ukrainian leagues for their respective sports. Budivelnyk was founded in 1945, Sokil was founded in 1963, during the existence of the Soviet Union. Both these teams play their home games at the Kyiv Palace of Sports.\n</p>\n<p>During the 1980 Summer Olympics held in the Soviet Union, Kyiv held the preliminary matches and the quarter-finals of the football tournament at its Olympic Stadium, which was reconstructed specially for the event. From 1 December 2008, the stadium underwent a full-scale reconstruction in order to satisfy standards put in place by UEFA for hosting the Euro 2012 football tournament; the opening ceremony took place in the presence of president Viktor Yanukovych on 8 October 2011, with the first major event being a Shakira concert which was specially planned to coincide with the stadium's re-opening during Euro 2012. Other notable sport stadiums/sport complexes in Kyiv include the Valeriy Lobanovskyi Dynamo Stadium, the Palace of Sports, among many others.\n</p><p>Most Ukrainian national teams play their home international matches in Kyiv. The Ukraine national football team, for example, will play matches at the re-constructed Olympic Stadium from 2011.\n</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Tourism\">Tourism</span></h3>\n<link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1033289096\">\n<p>Since introducing a visa-free regime for EU-member states and Switzerland in 2005, Ukraine has seen a steady increase in the number of foreign tourists visiting the country. Before the 2008\u201309 recession, the average annual growth in the number of foreign visits in Kyiv was 23% over a three-year period. In 2009, a total of 1.6\u00a0million tourists stayed in Kyiv hotels, of whom almost 259,000 (<abbr title=\"circa\">c.</abbr> 16%) were foreigners.</p><p>After UEFA Euro 2012, the city became the most popular destination for European tourists. A record number of 1.8 million foreign tourists was registered then along with about 2.5 million domestic tourists. More than 850,000 foreign tourists visited Kyiv in the first half of 2018, as compared to 660,000 tourists over the same period in 2013. As of 2018, the hotel occupancy rate from May to September averages 45\u201350%. Hostels and three-star hotels are approximately 90% full, four-star hotels 65\u201370%. Six five-star hotels average 50\u201355% occupancy. Ordinary tourists generally come from May to October, and business tourists from September to May.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"City_anthem\">City anthem</span></h3>\n<p>In 2014, the Kyiv city's council established the city's anthem. It became a 1962 song, \"Yak tebe ne liubyty, Kyieve mii!\" (<span title=\"Ukrainian-language text\"><span lang=\"uk\">\u042f\u043a \u0442\u0435\u0431\u0435 \u043d\u0435 \u043b\u044e\u0431\u0438\u0442\u0438, \u041a\u0438\u0454\u0432\u0435 \u043c\u0456\u0439!</span></span>, roughly \"How can I not love you, Kyiv of mine!\").\n</p>\n<h3><span id=\"City_symbols\">City symbols</span></h3>\n<p>The horse chestnut tree is one of the symbols of Kyiv. It was heavily present on the city's coat of arms used from 1969 to 1995.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Economy\">Economy</span></h2>\n<link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1033289096\">\n<p>As with most capital cities, Kyiv is a major administrative, cultural, and scientific centre of the country. It is the largest city in Ukraine in terms of both population and area and enjoys the highest levels of business activity. On 1 January 2010, there were around 238,000 business entities registered in Kyiv.</p><p>Official figures show that between 2004 and 2008 Kyiv's economy outstripped the rest of the country's, growing by an annual average of 11.5%. Following the global financial crisis that began in 2007, Kyiv's economy suffered a severe setback in 2009 with gross regional product contracting by 13.5% in real terms. Although a record high, the decline in activity was 1.6 percentage points smaller than that for the country as a whole. The economy in Kyiv, as in the rest of Ukraine, recovered somewhat in 2010 and 2011. Kyiv is a middle-income city, with prices comparable to many mid-size American cities (i.e., considerably lower than Western Europe).\n</p><p>Because the city has a large and diverse economic base and is not dependent on any single industry or company, its unemployment rate has historically been relatively low \u2013 only 3.75% over 2005\u20132008. Indeed, even as the rate of joblessness jumped to 7.1% in 2009, it remained far below the national average of 9.6%.</p><p>As of January 2022, the average monthly salary in Kyiv reached 21,347 UAH (\u20ac540) gross and 17,184 UAH (\u20ac430) net.</p><p>Kyiv is the undisputed center of business and commerce of Ukraine and home to the country's largest companies, such as Naftogaz Ukrainy, Energorynok and Kyivstar. In 2010, the city accounted for 18% of national retail sales and 24% of all construction activity. Real estate is one of the major forces in Kyiv's economy. Average prices of apartments are the highest in the country and among the highest in eastern Europe. Kyiv also ranks high in terms of commercial real estate and has Ukraine's tallest office buildings (such as Gulliver and Parus) and some of Ukraine's biggest shopping malls (such as Dream Town and Ocean Plaza).\n</p><p>In May 2011, Kyiv authorities presented a 15-year development strategy which calls for attracting as much as EUR82\u00a0billion of foreign investment by 2025 to modernize the city's transport and utilities infrastructure and make it more attractive for tourists.</p>\n<p><small>* \u2013 data not available;</small>\n<small>** \u2013 calculated at annual average official exchange rate;</small>\n<small>*** \u2013 ILO methodology (% of workforce).</small>\n</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Industry\">Industry</span></h3>\n<p>Primary industries in Kyiv include utilities \u2013 i.e., electricity, gas and water supply (26% of total industrial output), manufacture of food, beverages and tobacco products (22%), chemical (17%), mechanical engineering (13%) and manufacture of paper and paper products, including publishing, printing and reproduction of recorded media (11%).

Kyiv is home to Ukraine's ministry of education and science, and is also noted for its contributions to medical and computer science research.\n</p><p>In 2016, UNIT Factory (Ukrainian National IT Factory) opened. It offers a completely new format of IT education. The education is completely free for all trainees subject to compliance with the terms of the program. Within this project are the Technology Companies' Development Center (TCDC), BIONIC University open inter-corporate IT-university, as well as two hi-tech laboratories\u2014VR Lab (Crytek) and Smart City lab.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"University_education\">University education</span></h3>\n<p>Kyiv hosts many universities, the major ones being Kyiv National Taras Shevchenko University, the National Technical University \"Kyiv Polytechnic Institute\", Kyiv-Mohyla Academy and the Kyiv National University of Trade and Economics. Of these, the Mohyla Academy is the oldest, founded as a theological school in 1632, but Shevchenko University, founded in 1834, is the oldest in continuous operation. The total number of institutions of higher education in Kyiv approaches 200, allowing young people to pursue almost any line of study. While education traditionally remains largely in the hands of the state there are several accredited private institutions in the city.\n</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Secondary_education\">Secondary education</span></h3>\n<p>There are about 530 general secondary schools and about 680 nursery schools and kindergartens in Kyiv. Additionally, there are evening schools for adults, specialist technical schools, and the Evangel Theological Seminary.\n</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Public_libraries\">Public libraries</span></h3>\n<p>There are many libraries in the city, with the Vernadsky National Library, which is Ukraine's main academic library and scientific information centre, as well as one of the world's largest national libraries, being the largest and most important one. The National Library is affiliated with the Academy of Sciences in so far as it is a deposit library and thus serves as the academy's archives' store. The national library is the world's foremost repository of Jewish folk music recorded on Edison wax cylinders. Their Collection of Jewish Musical Folklore (1912\u20131947) was inscribed on UNESCO's Memory of the World Register in 2005.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Infrastructure\">Infrastructure</span></h2>\n<h3><span id=\"Transportation\">Transportation</span></h3>\n<link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1033289096\">\n<h4><span id=\"Local_public_transport\">Local public transport</span></h4>\n<p>Local public transportation in Kyiv includes the Metro, buses and minibuses, trolleybuses, trams, taxi and funicular. There is also an intra-city ring railway service.\n</p><p>The publicly owned and operated Kyiv Metro is the fastest, the most convenient and affordable network that covers most, but not all, of the city. The Metro is expanding towards the city limits to meet growing demand, having three lines with a total length of 66.1 kilometres (41.1 miles) and 51 stations (some of which are renowned architectural landmarks). The Metro carries around 1.422 million passengers daily accounting for 38% of the Kyiv's public transport load. In 2011, the total number of trips exceeded 519 million.</p><p>The historic tram system was the first electric tramway in the former Russian Empire and the third one in Europe after the Berlin Stra\u00dfembahn and the Budapest tramway. The tram system consists of 139.9\u00a0km (86.9\u00a0mi) of track, including 14\u00a0km (8.7\u00a0mi) two Rapid Tram lines, served by 21 routes with the use of 523 tram cars. Once a well maintained and widely used method of transport, the system is now gradually being phased out in favor of buses and trolleybuses.\n</p><p>The Kyiv Funicular was constructed during 1902\u20131905. It connects the historic Uppertown, and the lower commercial neighborhood of Podil through the steep Saint Volodymyr Hill overseeing the Dnieper River. The line consists of two stations.\n</p><p>All public road transport (except for some minibuses) is operated by the united Kyivpastrans municipal company. It is heavily subsidized by the city.\n</p><p>The Kyiv public transport system, except for taxi, uses a simple flat rate tariff system regardless of distance traveled: tickets or tokens must be purchased each time a vehicle is boarded. Digital ticket system is already established in Kyiv Metro, with plans for other transport modes. The cost of one ride is far lower than in Western Europe.\n</p><p>The taxi market in Kyiv is expansive but not regulated. In particular, the taxi fare per kilometer is not regulated. There is a fierce competition between private taxi companies.</p>\n<h4><span id=\"Roads_and_bridges\">Roads and bridges</span></h4>\n<p>Kyiv represents the focal point of Ukraine's \"national roads\" system, thus linked by road to all cities of the country. European routes <span typeof=\"mw:File\"></span>, <span typeof=\"mw:File\"></span> and <span typeof=\"mw:File\"></span> intersect in Kyiv.\n</p><p>There are eight Dnieper bridges and dozens of grade-separated intersections in the city. Several new intersections are under construction. There are plans to build a full-size, fully grade-separated ring road around Kyiv.</p><p>In 2009, Kyiv's roads were in poor technical condition and maintained inadequately.</p><p>Traffic jams and lack of parking space are growing problems for all road transport services in Kyiv.\n</p>\n<h4><span id=\"Air_transport\">Air transport</span></h4>\n<p>Kyiv is served by two international passenger airports: the Boryspil Airport 30 kilometres (19 miles) away, and the smaller, municipally owned Zhuliany Airport on the southern outskirts of the city. There are also the Hostomel cargo airport and additional three operating airfields facilitating the Antonov aircraft manufacturing company and general aviation.\n</p>\n<h4><span id=\"Railways\">Railways</span></h4>\n<p>Railways are Kyiv's main mode of intracity- and suburban transportation. The city has a developed railroad infrastructure including a long-distance passenger station, 6 cargo stations, depots, and repairing facilities. However, this system still fails to meet the demand for passenger service. Particularly, the Kyiv-Pasazhyrskyi railway station is the city's only long-distance passenger terminal (<i>vokzal</i>).\n</p><p>Construction is underway for turning the large Darnytsia railway station on the left-bank part of Kyiv into a long-distance passenger hub, which may ease traffic at the central station. Bridges over the Dnieper River are another problem restricting the development of city's railway system. Presently, only one rail bridge out of two is available for intense train traffic. A new combined rail-auto bridge is under construction, as a part of Darnytsia project.\n</p><p>In 2011, the Kyiv city administration established the new Urban Train for Kyiv. This service runs at standard 4- to 10-minute intervals throughout the day and follows a circular route around the city centre, which allows it to serve many of Kyiv's inner suburbs. Interchanges between the Kyiv Metro and Fast Tram exist at many of the urban train's station stops.</p><p>Suburban 'Kyiv City Express' trains (colloquially known as <i>elektrychka</i>) are serviced by the publicly owned Ukrainian Railways. The suburban train service is fast, and unbeatably safe in terms of traffic accidents. But the trains are not reliable, as they may fall significantly behind schedule, may not be safe in terms of crime, and the <i>elektrychka</i> cars are poorly maintained and overcrowded in rush hours.\n</p><p>There are nine <i>elektrychka</i> directions from Kyiv:</p>\n<ul><li>Bila Tserkva - Uzyn</li>\n<li>Fastiv</li>\n<li>Klavdiievo</li>\n<li>Myronivka - Bohuslav</li>\n<li>Nizhyn</li>\n<li>Ukrainka</li>\n<li>Vasylkiv</li>\n<li>Vyshhorod</li>\n<li>Yahotyn</li></ul><p>More than a dozen of <i>elektrychka</i> stops are within the city allowing residents of different neighborhoods to use the suburban trains.\n</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Energy\">Energy</span></h3>\n<p>DTEK Kyiv Electric Networks (formerly Kyivenergo) is the electric power distribution network operator for Kyiv, owned by oligarch Rinat Akhmetov. As of 2021 it had:</p>\n<ul><li>12,038\u00a0km of power transmission lines with a voltage of 0.4\u2013110 kV</li>\n<li>64 substations with a voltage of 35\u2013110 kV</li>\n<li>243 switchgears and 3728 transformer substations at 10 kV</li></ul><p>Kyivteploenergo operates a centralized heating system, which provides heating and hot water to customers through a network of pipes that distribute hot water from centralized heating plants to buildings throughout the city. It operates a 2700\u00a0km network, two of the largest combined heat and power plants in Ukraine CHP-5 and CHP-6, as well as the only waste incineration plant Energia (plant) operating in Ukraine.\n</p><p>In line with the EU Third Energy Package, since 2019 state energy policy abandoned the Rotterdam plus system and has required transmission system operator (TSO) and regional utilities unbundling in order to separate electricity distribution and retail electricity supply.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Water_and_sanitation\">Water and sanitation</span></h3>\n<p>The national government has delegated responsibility for water and sanitation services to local authorities. Kyivvodokanal is a private joint-stock company that provides such services to Kyiv. The length of water supply networks is 4231\u00a0km, of which 1798\u00a0km are dilapidated. The length of sewage networks is 2662\u00a0km, of which 830\u00a0km are dilapidated.\n</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Twin_towns_.E2.80.93_sister_cities\"></span><span id=\"Twin_towns_\u2013_sister_cities\">Twin towns \u2013 sister cities</span></h2>\n<link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1033289096\">\n<p>Kyiv is twinned with:</p>\n\n<h3><span id=\"Other_cooperation_agreements\">Other cooperation agreements</span></h3>\n<link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1184024115\">\n<h2><span id=\"Notable_people\">Notable people</span></h2>\n<ul><li><link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1033289096\"></li></ul><h3><span id=\"Arts.2C_literature.2C_and_entertainment\"></span><span id=\"Arts,_literature,_and_entertainment\">Arts, literature, and entertainment</span></h3>\n<ul><li>Leonid Bronevoy (1928\u20132017), Soviet and Russian actor</li>\n<li>Mikhail Bulgakov (1891\u20131940), Soviet writer, medical doctor and playwright</li>\n<li>Eugenia Chuprina (born 1971), poet, novelist, writer and playwright</li>\n<li>Daniel the Traveller, 12th-century travel writer from the Kievan Rus'</li>\n<li>Ilya Ehrenburg (1891\u20131967), Soviet writer, journalist, translator and cultural figure</li>\n<li>Andr\u00e9 Grabar (1896\u20131990), historian of Romanesque art and the art of the Eastern Roman Empire and the Bulgarian Empire</li>\n<li>Dmytro Hnatyuk (1925\u20132016), Soviet and Ukrainian opera singer</li>\n<li>Olha Haidamaka (born 1990), Ukrainian artist</li>\n<li>Milton Horn (1906\u20131995), Russian-American sculptor</li>\n<li>Vladimir Horowitz (1903\u20131989), American classical pianist</li>\n<li>Milla Jovovich (born 1975), American actress</li>\n<li>Sonya Koshkina (born 1985), Ukrainian journalist, editor-in-chief</li>\n<li>Kateryna Kukhar (born 1982), prima ballerina</li>\n<li>Danylo Knyshuk (born 1978), Ukrainian sculptor</li>\n<li>Ana Layevska (born 1982), Ukrainian-Mexican actress</li>\n<li>Boris Levit-Broun (born 1950), Russian poet, writer, and artist</li>\n<li>Serge Lifar (1905\u20131986), French ballet dancer</li>\n<li>Kazimir Malevich (1879\u20131935), pioneer of geometric abstract art and the originator of the avant-garde Suprematist movement</li>\n<li>Natalya Marchenkova (born 1948), animator and animation director, born in Kyiv</li>\n<li>Natalia Matsak (born 1982), ballet dancer</li>\n<li>Galyna Moskvitina (born 1963), painter</li>\n<li>Ivan Putrov (born 1980), dancer, former Principal with The Royal Ballet in London</li>\n<li>Maksym Petrenko (1983\u20132022), Ukrainian writer, scientist, inventor, educator, soldier</li>\n<li>Yudif Grigorevna Rozhavskaya (1923-1982), composer and pianist</li>\n<li>Natalya Semenchenko (born 1976), professor, writer, and publicist</li>\n<li>Lev Shestov (1866\u20131938), Russian existentialist philosopher</li>\n<li>Oksana Shvets (1955\u20132022), Ukrainian actress</li>\n<li>Alexander Vertinsky (1889\u20141957), singer, composer, poet, cabaret artist and actor</li>\n<li>Ludmila Anatolievna Yaroshevskaya (1906\u20131975), composer</li>\n<li>Artemy Vedel (1767\u20131808), composer</li></ul><h3><span id=\"Science_and_technology\">Science and technology</span></h3>\n<ul><li>Nikolai Amosov (1913\u20132002), Soviet and Ukrainian heart surgeon and inventor</li>\n<li>Zino Davidoff (1906\u20131994), Swiss premium tobacco manufacturer; known as \"King of Cigars\"</li>\n<li>Jan Koum (born 1976), American computer programmer, CEO and co-founder of WhatsApp</li>\n<li>Viktor Kaspruk, (born 1955), political scientist</li>\n<li>Alexander Ostrowski (1893\u20131986), mathematician</li>\n<li>Borys Paton (1918\u20132020), scientist, chairman of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine</li>\n<li>Igor Sikorsky (1889\u20131972), Russian-American aviation pioneer</li></ul><h3><span id=\"Politics_2\">Politics</span></h3>\n<ul><li>Golda Meir (1898\u20131978), Israeli politician, the fourth Prime Minister of Israel</li>\n<li>Henry P.
